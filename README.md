A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

The website will have the following functionality:

    Show a list of links from the database
    Add new links
    Add tags to the links
    Filter links by a tag
